      <h2 id="project-description">Project Description</h2>

      <p>I was experimenting with different printing techniques. I tried to use linoleum and fabric inks but it was not working very well. I do not have access to a dark room so I purchased a screen print and layed a vinyl cut over it as a mask rather than using the emulsion method. This project outlines my process. </p>

      <h2 id="process">Process</h2>

      <p>Started with importing an SVG of the Aurora map into Easel. Snazzy maps makes it very user friendly to create black/white maps. After inverting the image (Edit&gt; Flip Horizontally), I experimented with various cut settings and bits before deciding on doing a two-stage carve with 1/16‚Äù and 1/32‚Äù downcut bits.</p>

      <p><img src="images/auroraEaselshot.png" width="800" /></p>

      <p>I carved on a block of linoleum, I wanted to go down through the lino so my cut as very deep. I don‚Äôt think it needs to be cut to the same depth but you may want to experiment.</p>

      <hr />
      <p>Mixing the ink to match the color on the original canvas bag was quite a challenge. I purchased a variety of greens and primary colors to get it just right.</p>

      <p><img src="images/press1.JPG" width="800px" /></p>

      <p>Having no fabric printing experience, I thought it would work very similarly to paper but I was definitely mistaken. The fabric ink dried very fast on the lino block. I reached out to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jennaleighrichards/">@jennaleighrichards</a> for suggestions in printing with fabric. She recommended adding more even pressure and even a backing with batting to allow for pressure. We decided to create a large MDF press. It would consist of a top panel of MDF with holes at various positions for screws to go through and the bottom panel would have threaded inserts for the screws to secure.</p>

      <p>Tried the press a few different ways but the ink was still drying too fast on the lino block and printing inconsistently. I wanted solid lines.</p>

      <p><img src="images/linoblockprint.JPG" width="800" /></p>

      <hr />
      <p>Fast forward to a few weeks later. I purchased a Speedball ink which had a thinner consistency. The color was deeper but close enough to the emerald green I was looking for. This ink was still not really working on the lino block so I decided to try a different method: screenprinting.</p>

      <p>I purchased a screen from Blick and vinyl to use with the Cameo vinyl cutter. I exported the SVG file from Easel (Project &gt; Download .zip &gt; unzip and save the SVG only) and brought it into Cameo software. The SVG file must remai ‚Äúinverted‚Äù to ensure it prints correctly when the screen is flipped and inked.</p>

      <p><img src="images/vinyldetail.JPG" width="800" /></p>

      <p>Carefully peeled away the vinyl to expose the screen on the parts I wanted inked. The last step is to press on transfer tape, lift the vinyl from its backing and adhere to the screen. I also taped around the edges to create a frame around the map. When removing the transfer tape, some of the vinyl wanted to lift away from the screen. I had to remove this very slowly (con paciencia).</p>

      <table>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td><img src="images/testprint.JPG" /></td>
            <td><img src="images/testprint2.JPG" /></td>
            <td><img src="images/testprintdetail.JPG" /></td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>The screenprinting seems to work best on fabric that has less texture.</p>

      <p><img src="images/canvastest.JPG" width="400px" /></p>

      <p>I used cardboard inside the t-shirt to prevent ink from seeping to the front. Took a few tries to get the hang of running ink down the screen but over all, I think this was the best method.</p>

      <p>Hope you enjoyed this project! <br /></p>
