# Lightbox for "There's a fire in your backyard" by Tess Cramer

### Project 

First version of lightbox that illuminates a glass painting done by [Tess Cramer](https://www.instagram.com/tessctess/).

### Goal

I wanted to create a slim lightbox using as many recycled materials and my CNC machines. I had some leftover LED lightstrips, 2" x 4" boards to create the frame. I also wanted all the wires to be hidden and the lights to make it seem as the entire frame was glowing. 

### Materials

2" x 4" plywood scraps
12" LED strip
12v LED battery power supply with switch
PLA for 3D printed LED holder
glue, soldering tools, milling bits and lots of patience during prototyping.

### Process

The idea started when I purchased the original artwork by Tess. When she told me about the project, I got so many ideas on how to display the work as she envisioned it. I have been wanting to do collaborations with other artists and practice my own design skills (a.k.a. ignoring my own art projects). In this work, she is playing with the idea of light transmission and it is an amazing piece when held up against a window or a very lightbulb. I wanted to capture that in the slimest lightbox possible and also try to create something original myself. At first, I did not want to create a traditional lightbox as it was too easy in my mind. I wanted to reference this [project](https://www.inventables.com/projects/cherry-wooden-picture-frame) but the project shifted severely.

Here are prototypes and sketches of my original vision:
